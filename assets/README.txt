Platformer Art Deluxe (Kenney) helper assets folder

This folder may contain the extracted Kenney Platformer Art Deluxe asset pack.
If you used `scripts/download_kenney.py --url <zip-url>` the pack will be extracted
to `assets/platformer-art-deluxe/` and the script will attempt to copy a matching
character/player PNG to `assets/character.png` for the game to load.

Kenney assets are generally provided under CC0/public-domain-like terms. Always
check the original asset page for the specific asset license:
